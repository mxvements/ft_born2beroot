# Eval

## General Instructions

+ During the defense, as soon as you need help to verify a point, the student evaluated must help you
+ Ensure that the `signature.txt` file is present at the root of the cloned repository
+ Check that the signature contained in the .txt is identical to that of the `.vdi` file of the virtual machine to be evaluated. A simple `diff`should allow you to compare two signatures. If necessary, ask the student being evaluated where their .vdi file is located.
	+ `diff -- compare files line by line -- diff [OPTION]... FILES`
+ As a precaution, you can duplicate the initial virtual machine in order to keep a copy.
+ Start the virtual machine to be evaluated.
+ If sth doesn't work as espected or the two signatures differ, the evaluation stops here.

## Mandatory part

The project consists of creating and configuring a virtual machine following strict rulless. The student being evaluated will have to help you during the defense. Make sure that all of the following points are observed.

### Project overview

+ The student being evaluated should explainn to you simply:
	+ How a virtual machine works
	+ Their choice of operating system.
	+ The asic differences between Rocky and Debian
